# Hydrodynamic Model

## TUFLOFV 3D Hydrodynamic Model

The hydrodynamic modelling was undertaken using the [TUFLOW FV](https://www.tuflow.com/products/tuflow-fv/) software, which is developed and distributed by [BMT](https://www.bmt.org/). TUFLOW FV is a numerical hydrodynamic model solving the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Non-Linear Shallow Water Equations (NLSWE). The model is suitable for simulating a wide range of hydrodynamic systems ranging in scale from open channels and floodplains, through estuaries to coasts and deep offshore. The three-dimensional model was deployed in this study.

The Finite-Volume (FV) numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV solves the NLSWE on unstructured meshes comprised of triangular and quadrilateral elements. The flexible mesh allows for seamless boundary fitting along complex coastlines or channels as well as accurately and efficiently representing complex bathymetries with a minimum number of computational elements. The flexible mesh capability is particularly efficient at resolving a range of scales in a single model without requiring multiple domain nesting. In the present study, a flexible mesh of triangular elements with varying spatial resolution has been employed. Furthermore, the models developed by BMT incorporate a hybrid (fixed z-sigma) coordinate scheme. 

TUFLOW FV provides various options to vertically average 3D output and thereby simplify post-processing tasks. Both
MATLAB and Python visualisation libraries are available for download on the TUFLOW website to assist with review and presentation of 3D results. Further details regarding the numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV are provided in the [TUFLOW FV Science Manual](https://downloads.tuflow.com/_archive/TUFLOW_FV/Manual/TUFLOW_FV_User_Manual_2020.pdf).



## Model domain, mesh and bathymetry 


The hydrodynamic model domain is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:model-mesh)(left) and extends from Mandurah in the south to Quinns Rock (10 km North of JoondaluP) in the north, covering approximately 125 km of coastline. Offshore the model extends approximately 42 km into the Indian Ocean to depths greater than 250 m.
The model consists of 29837 horizontal mesh cells with dimensions varying from approximately 2.0 km at the offshore boundary, and decreasing to 100 m in the vicinity of the Sound. Figure \@ref(fig:model-mesh)(right) shows a detail of the model mesh in the study area which includes the downstream waterways of the [Swan River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_River_(Western_Australia)).
A 10 m digital elevation model (DEM) was adapted for the study area from a previously completed modelling project [@BMT2017]. A range of data sources were used for the bathymetry, including finer resolution multibeam data from the Australian Marine Complex (AMC) and Fremantle Ports Authority (FPA). Data from Geosciences Australia and General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) were used to complement the model domain bathymetry.

## Boundary conditions

The local hydrodynamics predicted by TUFLOW FV are influenced by boundary inputs. Information regarding appropriate boundary condition forcing for the study area was obtained from different sources. Details of the specific information sources used to the develop boundary conditions applied to the hydrodynamic model is proved below.



### ROMS - Tide, regional currents, salinity and temperature

The TUFLOWFV hydrodynamic model was provided with tides, regional current forcing (residual water level, current magnitude and direction), temperature and salinity profiles at the open boundary.

These data were provided by UWA as they sourced these from [ROMS](https://www.myroms.org/) (Regional Ocean Modelling System). It is a free-surface, primitive equations ocean model widely used by the scientific community for a diverse range of applications [@Haidvogel2000]. ROMS is used by UWA researchers through the whole state: from the Kimberley region to the north extending into South Australia. Within this domain there are a number of applications focusing on specific regions and processes [@Middleton2012].

The ROMS regional model extends from the Kimberley to Bass Strait, and has a few sub domains (ex;north-west, central-west and south-west) with 1-2 km horizontal resolution and 30 sigma layers in the vertical water column [@Middleton2012]. As described in Middleton et al (2012), the model was forced with daily atmospheric (wind and air pressure) and air sea fluxes (heat and freshwater). The model open boundaries were specified with monthly salinity and temperature climatology. The model forcing included tides and monthly mean sea levels. The model initial and forcing data were extracted from various global and Australian oceanographic/meteorological data sources and interpolated in to surface horizontal mesh and open boundary vertical sections. Details of the numerical algorithm of ROMS have been described in [@Shchepetkin2005].

It has a generalized vertical, terrain-following, coordinate system. In addition to that, horizontal velocity components, salinity and temperatures are computed on separate grids (Figure \@ref(fig:stv-grid)). Spatial resolution of ROMS data were post processed to linearly interpolate onto the TUFLOWFV model mesh. The locations at which ROMS data were sourced are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:roms-locations).

### BARRA - Atmospheric data

Atmospheric boundary condition data including

* air temperature

* downward long-wave radiation

* downward short-wave radiation

* mean sea level pressure

* precipitation rate

* relative humidity

* wind magnitude and direction at 10m

were sourced from [BARRA](http://www.bom.gov.au/research/projects/reanalysis/). BARRA is designed for providing multi-decadal (1990-2019) high spatial and temporal resolution, meteorological data from surface to lower stratosphere.  BARRA-R Regional 12 km domain within the light blue dotted box, covers all of Australia, New Zealand and the maritime continent. Smaller black boxes are the 1.5km subdomains centred over some major Australian cities, Sydney, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth (Figure \@ref(fig:barra-domain)).


Sourced reanalyses data and then applied to TUFLOW FV to support its simulation of water column heat dynamics. These model input fields were spatially uniform (i.e. gridded) but varied in time in order to represent both seasonal and higher-frequency variations (e.g. diurnal, weekly, etc..). The locations at which these data were sourced are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:barra-locations).

### Inflow - Swan River 

Freshwater flows draining to the Swan-Canning River estuary were also accounted for in the model. Canning river site and Narrows Bridge site were selected as tidal boundaries of the Swan River, based on data availability and the locality (Figure \@ref(fig:swanriver-bc)). Swan River boundary condition data including water level, salinity, temperature and nutrients were provided by UWA. Water level data at two tidal boundaries of the Swan river is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:swanriver-wl)
