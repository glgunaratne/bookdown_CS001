# Hydrodynamic Model

## TUFLOFV 3D Hydrodynamic Model

The hydrodynamic modelling was undertaken using the TUFLOW FV software, which is developed and distributed by BMT. TUFLOW FV is a numerical hydrodynamic model solving the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Non-Linear Shallow Water Equations (NLSWE). The model is suitable for simulating a wide range of hydrodynamic systems ranging in scale from open channels and floodplains, through estuaries to coasts and deep offshore. The three-dimensional model was deployed in this study.

The Finite-Volume (FV) numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV solves the NLSWE on unstructured meshes comprised of triangular and quadrilateral elements. The flexible mesh allows for seamless boundary fitting along complex coastlines or channels as well as accurately and efficiently representing complex bathymetries with a minimum number of computational elements. The flexible mesh capability is particularly efficient at resolving a range of scales in a single model without requiring multiple domain nesting. In the present study, a flexible mesh of triangular elements with varying spatial resolution has been employed. Furthermore, the models developed by BMT incorporate a hybrid (fixed z-sigma) coordinate scheme. 

TUFLOW FV provides various options to vertically average 3D output and thereby simplify post-processing tasks. Both
MATLAB and Python visualisation libraries are available for download on the TUFLOW website to assist with review and presentation of 3D results. Further details regarding the numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV are provided in the [TUFLOW FV Science Manual](https://downloads.tuflow.com/_archive/TUFLOW_FV/Manual/TUFLOW_FV_User_Manual_2020.pdf).
