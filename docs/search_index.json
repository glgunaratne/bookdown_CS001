Fundamental to assessing the impacts of future changes within Cockburn Sound and associated waters, and identifying useful mitigation options is the development of a water quality model able to link hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry and the essential ecosystem processes. Coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models can help focus management effort and provide a vehicle to bring together to the diversity of data that has been collected over many years and is being collected within this science program. Key attributes of the system that need to be clearly understood and quantified include oxygen, nutrients, sediment, algae and water clarity. The link between water quality and benthic communities such as seagrass in Cockburn Sound is also well established, and an integrated modelling tool is needed to quantify the links between them for the purposes of impact assessment and designing mitigation portfolios. This project will: Deliver the first base platform of a coupled hydrodynamic - water quality model for Cockburn Sound and surrounding waters â€“ termed the Cycle I model in the head agreement. The model developed under this agreement (UWA 2022) will be available for use by researchers and industry for scenario assessment, and further research and development. 1.2 Services Description Setup of Hydrodynamic-Biogeochemical Model for Cockburn Sound and surrounding waters Updated mesh, refined around Cockburn Sound and designed to nest within the regional ROMS model being used to supply oceanic boundary conditions Creation of processing scripts for creating ocean boundary condition files from ROMS, SCERM, and WRF model outputs using python, or as agreed with the project steering group Configuration of material zones in the simulation based on bathymetry and benthic substrate.

TUFLOW FV is a numerical hydrodynamic model that solves the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Non-Linear Shallow Water Equations (NLSWE) (BMT, 2019). The model is suitable for simulating a wide range of hydrodynamic systems ranging in scale from open channels and floodplains, through estuaries to coasts and oceans. The three-dimensional model was deployed in this study. The Finite-Volume (FV) numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV solves the NLSWE on both structured rectilinear grids and unstructured meshes comprised of triangular and quadrilateral elements. The flexible mesh allows for seamless boundary fitting along complex coastlines or channels as well as accurately and efficiently representing complex bathymetries with a minimum number of computational elements. The flexible mesh capability is particularly efficient at resolving a range of scales in a single model without requiring multiple domain nesting. TUFLOW FV simulated the fate and transport of dissolved quantities, salt, temperature and all water quality constituents using the Advection Dispersion (AD) module (Figure 3.1). The AD module determines the movement of quantities that relate to density and hence vertical (density driven) stratification, and the higher order scheme implemented by TUFLOW FV resolves and maintains these gradients. The AD module supports the use of tracers to undertake flushing studies such as in the case of the Mina Palace Flushing study. 2.3 Model domain 2.3.1 Model mesh 2.3.2 Bathymetry 2.4 Boundary conditions 2.4.1 Metrological data 2.4.2 Tidal data 2.4.3 Open ocean boundary data 2.4.4 Wave data 2.4.5 Inflow and discharge data "],["model-calibration.html", "Chapter 3 Model Calibration 3.1 Data Sourcing 3.2 Model validation", " Chapter 3 Model Calibration 3.1 Data Sourcing 3.1.1 ADCP data 3.1.2 Currents 3.1.3 Waves 3.1.4 Tempearure and Salinity 3.2 Model validation "],["sediment-transport-model.html", "Chapter 4 Sediment Transport Model 4.1 Data sourcing 4.2 TUFLOWFV Sediment transport Module 4.3 Uncalibrated model outputs", " Chapter 4 Sediment Transport Model 4.1 Data sourcing 4.1.1 Sediment fractions 4.1.2 Partcle size distribution 4.2 TUFLOWFV Sediment transport Module 4.3 Uncalibrated model outputs 4.3.1 TSS 4.3.2 Suspended solids "],["footnotes-and-citations.html", "Chapter 5 Footnotes and citations 5.1 Footnotes 5.2 Citations", " Chapter 5 Footnotes and citations 5.1 Footnotes Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[].
