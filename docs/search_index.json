TUFLOW FV is a numerical hydrodynamic model solving the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Non-Linear Shallow Water Equations (NLSWE). The model is suitable for simulating a wide range of hydrodynamic systems ranging in scale from open channels and floodplains, through estuaries to coasts and deep offshore. The three-dimensional model was deployed in this study. The Finite-Volume (FV) numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV solves the NLSWE on unstructured meshes comprised of triangular and quadrilateral elements. The flexible mesh allows for seamless boundary fitting along complex coastlines or channels as well as accurately and efficiently representing complex bathymetries with a minimum number of computational elements. The flexible mesh capability is particularly efficient at resolving a range of scales in a single model without requiring multiple domain nesting. In the present study, a flexible mesh of triangular elements with varying spatial resolution has been employed. Furthermore, the models developed by BMT incorporate a hybrid (fixed z-sigma) coordinate scheme. TUFLOW FV provides various options to vertically average 3D output and thereby simplify post-processing tasks. Both MATLAB and Python visualisation libraries are available for download on the TUFLOW website to assist with review and presentation of 3D results. Further details regarding the numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV are provided in the TUFLOW FV Science Manual. 3.2 Model domain, mesh and bathymetry The hydrodynamic model domain is shown in Figure 3.1(left) and extends from Mandurah in the south to Quinns Rock (10 km North of JoondaluP) in the north, covering approximately 125 km of coastline. Offshore the model extends approximately 42 km into the Indian Ocean to depths greater than 250 m. The model consists of 29837 horizontal mesh cells with dimensions varying from approximately 2.0 km at the offshore boundary, and decreasing to 100 m in the vicinity of the Sound. Figure 3.1(right) shows a detail of the model mesh in the study area which includes the downstream waterways of the Swan River. A 10 m digital elevation model (DEM) was adapted for the study area from a previously completed modelling project (BMT 2017). A range of data sources were used for the bathymetry, including finer resolution multibeam data from the Australian Marine Complex (AMC) and Fremantle Ports Authority (FPA). Data from Geosciences Australia and General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) were used to complement the model domain bathymetry. Figure 3.1: Hydrodynamic model domain and bathymetry 3.3 Boundary conditions The local hydrodynamics predicted by TUFLOW FV are influenced by boundary inputs. Information regarding appropriate boundary condition forcing for the study area was obtained from different sources. Details of the specific information sources used to the develop boundary conditions applied to the hydrodynamic model is proved below. 3.3.1 ROMS data ROMS is a free-surface, primitive equations ocean model widely used by the scientific community for a diverse range of applications.ROMS is used by UWA researchers through the whole state: from the Kimberley region to the north extending into southAustralia. Within this domain there are a number of applications focussing on specific regions and processes. The regional model extends from the Kimberley to Bass Strait, and has a few sub domains (ex, (northwest, centralwest and southwes) with 12 km horizontal resol)and 30 sigma layers in the vertical water column. The model was forced with daily atmospheric (wind and air pressure) and air sea fluxes (heat and freshwater). The model open boundaries were specified with monthly salinity and temperature climatology. The model forcing included tides and monthly mean sea levels. The model initial and forcing data (20002010) were extracted from various global and Australian oceanographic/meteorological data sources and interpolated in to surface horizontal mesh and open boundary vertical sections. It has a generalized vertical, terrain-following, coordinate system. 3.3.2 Tidal data 3.3.3 Open ocean boundary data 3.3.4 Wave data 3.3.5 Inflow and discharge data References "],["model-calibration.html", "Chapter 4 Model Calibration 4.1 Data Sourcing 4.2 Model validation", " Chapter 4 Model Calibration 4.1 Data Sourcing 4.1.1 ADCP data 4.1.2 Currents 4.1.3 Waves 4.1.4 Tempearure and Salinity 4.2 Model validation "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
