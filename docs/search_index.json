Fundamental to assessing the impacts of future changes within Cockburn Sound and associated waters (Figure 1.1), and identifying useful mitigation options is the development of a water quality model able to link hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry and the essential ecosystem processes. Coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models can help focus management effort and provide a vehicle to bring together to the diversity of data that has been collected over many years and is being collected within this science program. Key attributes of the system that need to be clearly understood and quantified include oxygen, nutrients, sediment, algae and water clarity. The link between water quality and benthic communities such as seagrass in Cockburn Sound is also well established, and an integrated modelling tool is needed to quantify the links between them for the purposes of impact assessment and designing mitigation portfolios. Figure 1.1: Scope area - Cockburn Sound and associated waters BMT was commissioned by the Aquatic Ecodynamic Research Group of the University Of western Australia to deliver the first base platform of a coupled hydrodynamic - water quality model for Cockburn Sound and surrounding waters  termed the Cycle I model in the head agreement (UWA 2022). The model developed under this agreement will be available for use by researchers and industry for scenario assessment, and further research and development.** 1.2 Study site description Cockburn Sound is a semi-enclosed embayment bounded by the mainland to the east and south, and Garden Island to the west. The main opening to the Sound is to the north between Woodman Point (east) and the northeast tip of Garden Island. A causeway linking Rockingham to the southern end of Garden Island completes the western boundary of the Sound. This causeway was completed in 1974 and contains two openings 300 m and 600 m wide. Cockburn Sound extends approximately 15 km from north to south and up to 9 km from east to west. The width reduces in the south, being approximately up to 5 km between the Causeway and East Rockingham. The Sound can be split into two main regions, a deep central basin with depths between 17 and 22 m and a marginal shore area with depths of up to 12.0 m particularly prominent on the eastern boundary (Figure 1.2). The deep basin occupies approximately 60% of the Cockburn Sound area (total of 110 km2). Waters immediately north of the Sound (i.e.Â between Carnac Island and Owen Anchorage) sit on a sill that is relatively shallow with depths ranging between 2.0 and 5.0 m. Success and Parmelia Channel with depths of approximately 15.0 m deep are routinely dredged to allow shipping traffic in and out of Cockburn Sound. A range of shipping channels inside the Sound provides access to the local industry berths, including Woodman Channel, Jervoise Channel, Median Channel, Calista Channel and Stirling Channel. In particular, Calista and Stirling channels are relevant for the movement of the PDSP brine effluent in Cockburn Sound (CWR 2007).

The fully integrated model resolved the regional hydrodynamics, sediment transport and biogeochemistry of the Cockburn Sound existing pressures including wastewater and desalination discharges. 2.1 Key Model Components There are three key components of the integrated model (Figure 2.1): Hydrodynamic The primary aim of the hydrodynamic model was to provide a precise representation of currents for determining the fate of the nutrient constituents and sediments. The hydrodynamic model is dynamically coupled to the sediment transport module and water quality module driving ecosystem processes such as the magnitude of nutrient and sediment fluxes through to the temperature dependence of primary productivity. Wave Wave modelling was included in the assessment to capture sediment resuspension and dispersion from wave action in shallow areas, likely to be significant in determining sediment movements under ambient conditions. Sediment transport This study has simulated the resuspension, dispersion and settling of sediment released into the water column under ambient conditions using a coupled hydrodynamic and sediment transport model. Water quality The water quality model has ability to simulate interactions between biogeochemical variables including oxygen, carbon, nutrients (organic and inorganic), light, temperature, algal and zooplankton species. Figure 2.1: Components of the integrated biogeochemical model used in this study The following three chapters summarise the methods applied, and assumptions made that underpin the integrated biogeochemical model used in this study, including the model set-ups for each of the model components and the rationale supporting the model assumptions.

TUFLOW FV is a numerical hydrodynamic model solving the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Non-Linear Shallow Water Equations (NLSWE). The model is suitable for simulating a wide range of hydrodynamic systems ranging in scale from open channels and floodplains, through estuaries to coasts and deep offshore. The three-dimensional model was deployed in this study. The Finite-Volume (FV) numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV solves the NLSWE on unstructured meshes comprised of triangular and quadrilateral elements. The flexible mesh allows for seamless boundary fitting along complex coastlines or channels as well as accurately and efficiently representing complex bathymetries with a minimum number of computational elements. The flexible mesh capability is particularly efficient at resolving a range of scales in a single model without requiring multiple domain nesting. In the present study, a flexible mesh of triangular elements with varying spatial resolution has been employed. Furthermore, the models developed by BMT incorporate a hybrid (fixed z-sigma) coordinate scheme. TUFLOW FV provides various options to vertically average 3D output and thereby simplify post-processing tasks. Both MATLAB and Python visualisation libraries are available for download on the TUFLOW website to assist with review and presentation of 3D results. Further details regarding the numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV are provided in the TUFLOW FV Science Manual. 3.2 Model domain, mesh and bathymetry The hydrodynamic model domain is shown in Figure 3.1(left) and extends from Mandurah in the south to Quinns Rock (10 km North of JoondaluP) in the north, covering approximately 125 km of coastline. Offshore the model extends approximately 42 km into the Indian Ocean to depths greater than 250 m. The model consists of 29837 horizontal mesh cells with dimensions varying from approximately 2.0 km at the offshore boundary, and decreasing to 100 m in the vicinity of the Sound. Figure 3.1(right) shows a detail of the model mesh in the study area which includes the downstream waterways of the Swan River. A 10 m digital elevation model (DEM) was adapted for the study area from a previously completed modelling project (BMT 2017). A range of data sources were used for the bathymetry, including finer resolution multibeam data from the Australian Marine Complex (AMC) and Fremantle Ports Authority (FPA). Data from Geosciences Australia and General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) were used to complement the model domain bathymetry. Figure 3.1: Hydrodynamic model domain and bathymetry 3.3 Boundary conditions The local hydrodynamics predicted by TUFLOW FV are influenced by boundary inputs. Information regarding appropriate boundary condition forcing for the study area was obtained from different sources. Details of the specific information sources used to the develop boundary conditions applied to the hydrodynamic model is proved below. 3.3.1 Tide, regional currents, wind and ROMS data The TUFLOWFV hydrodynamic model was provided with tides, regional current forcing (residual water level, current magnitude and direction), temperature and salinity profiles at the open boundary. These data were provided by UWA as they sourced these from ROMS. It is a free-surface, primitive equations ocean model widely used by the scientific community for a diverse range of applications (Haidvogel DB 2000). ROMS is used by UWA researchers through the whole state: from the Kimberley region to the north extending into southAustralia. Within this domain there are a number of applications focussing on specific regions and processes (Middleton JF 2012). The ROMS regional model extends from the Kimberley to Bass Strait, and has a few sub domains (ex;north-west, central-west and south-west) with 1-2 km horizontal resolution and 30 sigma layers in the vertical water column (Middleton JF 2012). As described in Middleton et al (2012), the model was forced with daily atmospheric (wind and air pressure) and air sea fluxes (heat and freshwater). The model open boundaries were specified with monthly salinity and temperature climatology. The model forcing included tides and monthly mean sea levels. The model initial and forcing data were extracted from various global and Australian oceanographic/meteorological data sources and interpolated in to surface horizontal mesh and open boundary vertical sections. Details of the numerical algorithm of ROMS have been described in (McWilliams JC 2005). It has a generalized vertical, terrain-following, coordinate system. 3.3.2 Tidal data 3.3.3 Open ocean boundary data 3.3.4 Wave data 3.3.5 Inflow and discharge data References "],["model-calibration.html", "Chapter 4 Model Calibration 4.1 Data Sourcing 4.2 Model validation", " Chapter 4 Model Calibration 4.1 Data Sourcing 4.1.1 ADCP data 4.1.2 Currents 4.1.3 Waves 4.1.4 Tempearure and Salinity 4.2 Model validation "],["sediment-transport-model.html", "Chapter 5 Sediment Transport Model 5.1 Data sourcing 5.2 TUFLOWFV Sediment transport Module 5.3 Uncalibrated model outputs", " Chapter 5 Sediment Transport Model 5.1 Data sourcing 5.1.1 Sediment fractions 5.1.2 Partcle size distribution 5.2 TUFLOWFV Sediment transport Module 5.3 Uncalibrated model outputs 5.3.1 TSS 5.3.2 Suspended solids "],["footnotes-and-citations.html", "Chapter 6 Footnotes and citations 6.1 Footnotes 6.2 Citations", " Chapter 6 Footnotes and citations 6.1 Footnotes Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[].
