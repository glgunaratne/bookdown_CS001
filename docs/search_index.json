Fundamental to assessing the impacts of future changes within Cockburn Sound and associated waters (Figure 1.1), and identifying useful mitigation options is the development of a water quality model able to link hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry and the essential ecosystem processes. Coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models can help focus management effort and provide a vehicle to bring together to the diversity of data that has been collected over many years and is being collected within this science program. Key attributes of the system that need to be clearly understood and quantified include oxygen, nutrients, sediment, algae and water clarity. The link between water quality and benthic communities such as seagrass in Cockburn Sound is also well established, and an integrated modelling tool is needed to quantify the links between them for the purposes of impact assessment and designing mitigation portfolios. Figure 1.1: Scope area - Cockburn Sound and associated waters BMT was commissioned by the Aquatic Ecodynamic Research Group of the University Of western Australia to deliver the first base platform of a coupled hydrodynamic - water quality model for Cockburn Sound and surrounding waters  termed the Cycle I model in the head agreement (UWA 2022).

The main opening to the Sound is to the north between Woodman Point (east) and the northeast tip of Garden Island. A causeway linking Rockingham to the southern end of Garden Island completes the western boundary of the Sound. This causeway was completed in 1974 and contains two openings 300 m and 600 m wide. Cockburn Sound extends approximately 15 km from north to south and up to 9 km from east to west. The width reduces in the south, being approximately up to 5 km between the Causeway and East Rockingham. The Sound can be split into two main regions, a deep central basin with depths between 17 and 22 m and a marginal shore area with depths of up to 12.0 m particularly prominent on the eastern boundary (Figure 2.1). The deep basin occupies approximately 60% of the Cockburn Sound area (total of 110 km2). Waters immediately north of the Sound (i.e. between Carnac Island and Owen Anchorage) sit on a sill that is relatively shallow with depths ranging between 2.0 and 5.0 m. Success and Parmelia Channel with depths of approximately 15.0 m deep are routinely dredged to allow shipping traffic in and out of Cockburn Sound. A range of shipping channels inside the Sound provides access to the local industry berths, including Woodman Channel, Jervoise Channel, Median Channel, Calista Channel and Stirling Channel. In particular, Calista and Stirling channels are relevant for the movement of the PDSP brine effluent in Cockburn Sound (CWR 2007). Figure 2.1: Key channels and outfalls in the Cockburn Sound As described by Lourey et al Lourey MJ and LC (2021) the following features of Cockburn Sound identified as driving the need for a coordinated response to environmental management. A semi-enclosed waterbody, relatively protected from wind and wave action leading to to poor flushing conditions. One of the most intensely used marine areas in Western Australia.

An established industrial hub with multiple discharges, ports and a desalination plant Location of a number of proposed major developments (Perth Seawater Desalination Plant II and Westport) Adjacent the rapidly developing urban centre of Rockingham Subject to a number of pressures and stressors and has a history of environmental degradation (particularly eutrophication) An area of cultural significance to the Beeliar Nyungar known as Derbal Nara 2.2 Data Collection References "],["integrated-modelling-approach.html", "Chapter 3 Integrated Modelling Approach 3.1 Key Model Components", " Chapter 3 Integrated Modelling Approach The integrated approach to modelling the dynamic feedbacks between biotic and physical processes was used to simulate biogeochemical reponses to the future development and assess risk levels for environmental impact. The fully integrated model resolved the regional hydrodynamics, sediment transport and biogeochemistry of the Cockburn Sound existing pressures including wastewater and desalination discharges. 3.1 Key Model Components There are three key components of the integrated model (Figure 3.1): Hydrodynamic The primary aim of the hydrodynamic model was to provide a precise representation of currents for determining the fate of the nutrient constituents and sediments. The hydrodynamic model is dynamically coupled to the sediment transport module and water quality module driving ecosystem processes such as the magnitude of nutrient and sediment fluxes through to the temperature dependence of primary productivity. Wave Wave modelling was included in the assessment to capture sediment resuspension and dispersion from wave action in shallow areas, likely to be significant in determining sediment movements under ambient conditions. Sediment transport This study has simulated the resuspension, dispersion and settling of sediment released into the water column under ambient conditions using a coupled hydrodynamic and sediment transport model. Water quality The water quality model has ability to simulate interactions between biogeochemical variables including oxygen, carbon, nutrients (organic and inorganic), light, temperature, algal and zooplankton species. Figure 3.1: Components of the integrated biogeochemical model used in this study The following three chapters summarise the methods applied, and assumptions made that underpin the integrated biogeochemical model used in this study, including the model set-ups for each of the model components and the rationale supporting the model assumptions.

TUFLOW FV is a numerical hydrodynamic model solving the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Non-Linear Shallow Water Equations (NLSWE). The model is suitable for simulating a wide range of hydrodynamic systems ranging in scale from open channels and floodplains, through estuaries to coasts and deep offshore. The three-dimensional model was deployed in this study. The Finite-Volume (FV) numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV solves the NLSWE on unstructured meshes comprised of triangular and quadrilateral elements. The flexible mesh allows for seamless boundary fitting along complex coastlines or channels as well as accurately and efficiently representing complex bathymetries with a minimum number of computational elements. The flexible mesh capability is particularly efficient at resolving a range of scales in a single model without requiring multiple domain nesting. In the present study, a flexible mesh of triangular elements with varying spatial resolution has been employed. Furthermore, the models developed by BMT incorporate a hybrid (fixed z-sigma) coordinate scheme. TUFLOW FV provides various options to vertically average 3D output and thereby simplify post-processing tasks. Both MATLAB and Python visualisation libraries are available for download on the TUFLOW website to assist with review and presentation of 3D results. Further details regarding the numerical scheme employed by TUFLOW FV are provided in the TUFLOW FV Science Manual. 4.2 Model domain, mesh and bathymetry The hydrodynamic model domain is shown in Figure 4.1(left) and extends from Mandurah in the south to Quinns Rock (10 km North of JoondaluP) in the north, covering approximately 125 km of coastline. Offshore the model extends approximately 42 km into the Indian Ocean to depths greater than 250 m. The model consists of 29837 horizontal mesh cells with dimensions varying from approximately 2.0 km at the offshore boundary, and decreasing to 100 m in the vicinity of the Sound. Figure 4.1(right) shows a detail of the model mesh in the study area which includes the downstream waterways of the Swan River. A 10 m digital elevation model (DEM) was adapted for the study area from a previously completed modelling project (BMT 2017). A range of data sources were used for the bathymetry, including finer resolution multibeam data from the Australian Marine Complex (AMC) and Fremantle Ports Authority (FPA). Data from Geosciences Australia and General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) were used to complement the model domain bathymetry. Figure 4.1: Hydrodynamic model domain and bathymetry 4.3 Boundary conditions The local hydrodynamics predicted by TUFLOW FV are influenced by boundary inputs. Information regarding appropriate boundary condition forcing for the study area was obtained from different sources. Details of the specific information sources used to the develop boundary conditions applied to the hydrodynamic model is proved below. 4.3.1 ROMS - Tide, regional currents, salinity and temperature The TUFLOWFV hydrodynamic model was provided with tides, regional current forcing (residual water level, current magnitude and direction), temperature and salinity profiles at the open boundary. These data were provided by UWA as they sourced these from ROMS (Regional Ocean Modelling System). It is a free-surface, primitive equations ocean model widely used by the scientific community for a diverse range of applications (Haidvogel DB 2000). ROMS is used by UWA researchers through the whole state: from the Kimberley region to the north extending into South Australia. Within this domain there are a number of applications focusing on specific regions and processes (Middleton JF 2012). The ROMS regional model extends from the Kimberley to Bass Strait, and has a few sub domains (ex;north-west, central-west and south-west) with 1-2 km horizontal resolution and 30 sigma layers in the vertical water column (Middleton JF 2012). As described in Middleton et al (2012), the model was forced with daily atmospheric (wind and air pressure) and air sea fluxes (heat and freshwater). The model open boundaries were specified with monthly salinity and temperature climatology. The model forcing included tides and monthly mean sea levels. The model initial and forcing data were extracted from various global and Australian oceanographic/meteorological data sources and interpolated in to surface horizontal mesh and open boundary vertical sections. Details of the numerical algorithm of ROMS have been described in (McWilliams JC 2005). It has a generalized vertical, terrain-following, coordinate system. In addition to that, horizontal velocity components, salinity and temperatures are computed on separate grids (Figure 4.2). Spatial resolution of ROMS data were post processed to linearly interpolate onto the TUFLOWFV model mesh. The locations at which ROMS data were sourced are shown in Figure 4.3. Figure 4.2: A snapshot of ROMS seprate grids for salinity, temeperatire and velocty components Figure 4.3: ROMS data sourcing locations 4.3.2 BARRA - Atmospheric data Atmospheric boundary condition data including air temperature downward long-wave radiation downward short-wave radiation mean sea level pressure precipitation rate relative humidity wind magnitude and direction at 10m were sourced from BARRA. BARRA is designed for providing multi-decadal (1990-2019) high spatial and temporal resolution, meteorological data from surface to lower stratosphere. BARRA-R Regional 12 km domain within the light blue dotted box, covers all of Australia, New Zealand and the maritime continent. Smaller black boxes are the 1.5km subdomains centred over some major Australian cities, Sydney, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth (Figure 4.4). Sourced reanalyses data and then applied to TUFLOW FV to support its simulation of water column heat dynamics. These model input fields were spatially uniform (i.e. gridded) but varied in time in order to represent both seasonal and higher-frequency variations (e.g. diurnal, weekly, etc..). The locations at which these data were sourced are shown in Figure 4.5. Figure 4.4: BARRA domains and sub-domains (Sourced from BOM http://www.bom.gov.au/research/projects/reanalysis/) Figure 4.5: BARRA data sourcing locations 4.3.3 SWAN - Wave Model Wave modelling was included in the assessment to capture sediment resuspension and dispersion from wave action in shallow areas, likely to be significant in determining sediment plume behaviour. The wave modelling component of these assessments has been undertaken using the third generation wave model Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN). It is an Eulerian formulation of the discrete action balance equation (Booji N 1996). Since it preserves the action density in ambient currents, it was selected as a tool to perform the required simulations of wave-current interaction. SWAN simulates wave/swell propagation in two-dimensions, including shoaling and refraction due to spatial variations in bathymetry and currents. This is a global industry standard modelling package that has been applied with reliable results to many investigations worldwide. For sediment re-suspension and dispersion modelling the SWAN wave model was coupled with the 3D TUFLOW FV hydrodynamic and advection-dispersion models. This required the wave simulations to be completed separately, with the model output stored at hourly intervals on regular grids. During the subsequent sediment re-suspension and dispersion simulations, the wave conditions were linearly interpolated spatially from the grids to the TUFLOW FV mesh. Previously used calibrated SWAN model (BMT 2022) was recommissioned for this work. A two-grid nesting approach was adopted for the study. The grid set-up was as follows: A regional-scale model, A-grid, (Figure 4.6) was set up in order to introduce the offshore wave forcing conditions to the study area. A-grid covers an area of approximately 76.5 km (east-west) by 112.6 km (north-south). To ensure that the wave transformation over the nearshore shelf is properly replicated by the wave model the domain extended offshore to 500 m water depth. The size of the regional scale domain enabled the input of spatially and temporally variable offshore wave conditions across the boundaries. The regional scale model was forced by several offshore wave data points obtained from global wave models. This approach is considered significantly more robust than the conventional method using one point of measured (or modelled) data as the offshore boundary. Adopting this approach, the modelling framework captured the offshore wave variability across the boundaries resulting in more accurate and reliable nearshore wave predictions. An intermediate scale model, B-grid, (Figure 4.6) was set up to refine the resolution of the solutions from A-grid; B-grid extends approximately 43 km offshore and 75 km alongshore. The domain size and model resolutions are outlined in Table 4.1.

Canning river site and Narrows Bridge site were selected as tidal boundaries of the Swan River, based on data availability and the locality (Figure 4.7). Swan River boundary condition data including water level, salinity, temperature and nutrients were provided by UWA. Water level data at two tidal boundaries of the Swan river is shown in Figure 4.8 Figure 4.7: Tidal boundary locations (Canning River site Narrows Bridge site) in the downstream area of the Swan River Figure 4.8: Daily water level changes at Canning River site Narrows Bridge site from 2010-2021 4.3.5 Discharges and Intakes Intakes and outfalls for other industries operating in Cockburn Sound were adopted in the model. These data were sourced from previous BMT projects (BMT 2014, 2017) are summarised in Table 4.2. The relevant intake and discharge locations are shown in Figure 4.9. A 100% DO saturation (based on temperature and salinity and BMT (2017)) was assumed for the boundary conditions.

Between the model surface and -3.0 mMSL four flexible sigma layers were applied and were able to vary in vertical thickness depending on the tidally dominated changes in water surface elevation. Below -3.0 mMSL a z-coordinate scheme was applied with vertical layer thicknesses of 0.5 m in shallow water (between depths of -3.0 mMSL and -22.0 mMSL) increasing in deeper offshore areas beyond the edge of the continental shelf. A maximum of 30 z-layers were resolved in the deeper sections of the model domain. This high degree of vertical resolution in the top 22.0 m of the water column was necessary in order to simulate vertical stratification within the water column. 4.4.2 Active scalars Salinity and temperature were simulated within the model as density-coupled scalar constituents in order to incorporate baroclinic density gradient forcing and more importantly the effect of vertical density stratification on turbulent mixing in the water column. 4.4.3 Bottom roughness A default global default bottom roughness length scale (ks) of 0.002 m was used except in at the edge of the shelf, where ks was set to 0.2 m with spatial reconstruction used within Cockburn Sound to capture the domain transitioning from the shallow eastern shelf to the waters in the deep central basin. The adjustment of the local values for ks was undertaken as part of the hydrodynamic model calibration process conducted at Cockburn Sound scale (BMT 2022). 4.4.4 Turbulence closure scheme The General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) was coupled with the 3D TUFLOW FV hydrodynamic model in order to simulate the vertical mixing processes in the presence of density stratification (http://www.gotm.net/). Further details of the TUFLOW FV model configuration and parameterisation are summarised in Table 4.3.
